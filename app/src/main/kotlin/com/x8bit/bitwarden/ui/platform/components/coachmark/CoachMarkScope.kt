 * Defines the scope for creating coach mark highlights within a user interface.

     * associated tooltip that can display a title, description, and actions.
     *
     * @param key The unique key identifying this highlight. This key is used to
     * manage the state and order of the coach mark sequence.
     * @param title The title of the coach mark, displayed in the tooltip.
     * @param description The description of the coach mark, providing more context
     * to the user. Displayed in the tooltip.
     * @param shape The shape of the highlight. Defaults to [CoachMarkHighlightShape.SQUARE].
     * Use [CoachMarkHighlightShape.OVAL] for a circular highlight.
     * @param onDismiss An optional callback that is invoked when the coach mark is dismissed
     * (e.g., by clicking the close button). If provided, this function
     * will be executed after the coach mark is dismissed. If not provided,
     * no action is taken on dismissal.
     * @param leftAction An optional composable to be displayed on the left side of the
     * action row in the tooltip. This can be used to provide
     * additional actions or controls.
     * @param rightAction An optional composable to be displayed on the right side of the
     * action row in the tooltip. This can be used to provide
     * primary actions or navigation.
     * @param anchorContent The composable content to be highlighted. This is the UI element
     * that will be visually emphasized by the coach mark.
