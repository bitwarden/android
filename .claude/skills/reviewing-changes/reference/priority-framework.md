# Issue Priority Framework

Use this framework to classify findings during code review. Clear prioritization helps authors triage and address issues effectively.

## Inline Comment Requirement

Create separate inline comment for EACH specific issue on the exact line (`file:line_number`).
Do NOT create one large summary comment. Do NOT update existing comments.

## Critical (Blocker - Must Fix Before Merge)

These issues **must** be addressed before the PR can be merged. They pose immediate risks to security, stability, or architecture integrity.

### Security
- Data leaks or plaintext sensitive data (passwords, keys, tokens)
- Weak encryption or insecure key storage
- Missing authentication or authorization checks
- Input injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection)
- Sensitive data in logs or error messages

**Example**:
```
**data/vault/VaultRepository.kt:145** - CRITICAL: PIN stored without encryption
PIN must be encrypted using Android Keystore, not stored in plaintext SharedPreferences.
Reference: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#security
```

### Stability
- Compilation errors or warnings
- Null pointer exceptions in production paths
- Resource leaks (file handles, network connections, memory)
- Crashes or unhandled exceptions in critical paths
- Thread safety violations

**Example**:
```
**app/auth/BiometricRepository.kt:120** - CRITICAL: Missing null safety check
biometricPrompt result can be null. Add explicit null check to prevent crash.
```

### Architecture
- Mutable state exposure in ViewModels (violates MVVM)
- Exception-based error handling in business logic (should use Result)
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Violation of zero-knowledge principles
- Direct dependency instantiation (should use DI)

**Example**:
```
**app/login/LoginViewModel.kt:45** - CRITICAL: Exposes mutable state
Change MutableStateFlow to StateFlow in public API to prevent external state mutation.
This violates MVVM encapsulation pattern.
```

## Important (Should Fix)

These issues should be addressed but don't block merge if there's a compelling reason. They improve code quality, maintainability, or robustness.

### Testing
- Missing tests for critical paths (authentication, encryption, data sync)
- Missing tests for new public APIs
- Tests that don't verify actual behavior (test implementation, not behavior)
- Missing test coverage for error scenarios

**Example**:
```
**data/auth/BiometricRepository.kt** - IMPORTANT: Missing test for cancellation
Add test for user cancellation scenario to prevent regression.
```

### Architecture
- Inconsistent patterns within PR (mixing error handling approaches)
- Poor separation of concerns
- Tight coupling between components
- Not following established project patterns

**Example**:
```
**app/vault/VaultViewModel.kt:89** - IMPORTANT: Business logic in ViewModel
Encryption logic should be in Repository, not ViewModel.
Reference: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#mvvm-pattern
```

### Documentation
- Undocumented public APIs (missing KDoc)
- Missing documentation for complex algorithms
- Unclear naming or confusing interfaces

**Example**:
```
**core/crypto/EncryptionManager.kt:34** - IMPORTANT: Missing KDoc
Public encryption method should document parameters, return value, and exceptions.
```

### Performance
- Inefficient algorithms in hot paths (with evidence from profiling)
- Blocking main thread with I/O operations
- Memory inefficient data structures (with evidence)

**Example**:
```
**app/vault/VaultListViewModel.kt:78** - IMPORTANT: N+1 query pattern
Fetching items one-by-one in loop. Consider batch fetch to reduce database queries.
```

## Suggested (Nice to Have)

These are improvement opportunities but not required. Consider the effort vs. benefit before requesting changes.

### Code Quality
- Minor style inconsistencies (if not caught by linter)
- Opportunities for DRY improvements
- Better variable naming for clarity
- Simplification opportunities

**Example**:
```
**app/vault/VaultScreen.kt:145** - SUGGESTED: Consider extracting helper function
This 20-line block appears in 3 places. Consider extracting to reduce duplication.
```

### Testing
- Additional test coverage for edge cases (beyond critical paths)
- More comprehensive integration tests
- Performance tests for non-critical paths

**Example**:
```
**app/login/LoginViewModelTest.kt** - SUGGESTED: Add test for concurrent login attempts
Not critical, but would increase confidence in edge case handling.
```

### Refactoring
- Extracting reusable patterns
- Modernizing old patterns (if touching related code)
- Improving testability

**Example**:
```
**data/vault/VaultRepository.kt:200** - SUGGESTED: Consider extracting validation logic
Could be extracted to separate validator class for reusability and testing.
```

## Optional (Acknowledge But Don't Require)

Note good practices to reinforce positive patterns. Keep these **brief** - list only, no elaboration.

### Good Practices

**Format**: Simple bullet list, no explanation

```markdown
## Good Practices
- Proper Hilt DI usage throughout
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented public APIs
```

**Don't do this** (too verbose):
```markdown
## Good Practices
- Proper Hilt DI usage throughout: Great job using @Inject constructor and injecting interfaces! This follows our established patterns perfectly and makes the code very testable. Really excellent work here! üëç
```

## Classification Guidelines

### When Something is Between Categories

**If unsure between Critical and Important**:
- Ask: "Could this cause production incidents, data loss, or security breaches?"
- If yes ‚Üí Critical
- If no ‚Üí Important

**If unsure between Important and Suggested**:
- Ask: "Would I block merge over this?"
- If yes ‚Üí Important
- If no ‚Üí Suggested

**If unsure between Suggested and Optional**:
- Ask: "Is this actionable feedback or just acknowledgment?"
- If actionable ‚Üí Suggested
- If acknowledgment ‚Üí Optional

### Context Matters

**Same issue, different contexts**:

```
// Critical for production code
Missing null safety check in auth flow ‚Üí CRITICAL

// Suggested for internal test utility
Missing null safety check in test helper ‚Üí SUGGESTED
```

**Same pattern, different risk levels**:

```
// Critical for new feature
Missing tests for new auth method ‚Üí CRITICAL

// Important for bug fix
Missing regression test ‚Üí IMPORTANT

// Suggested for refactoring
Missing tests for refactored helper ‚Üí SUGGESTED
```

## Examples by Change Type

### Dependency Update
- **Critical**: Known CVEs in old version not addressed
- **Important**: Breaking changes that need migration
- **Suggested**: Beta/alpha version stability concerns

### Bug Fix
- **Critical**: Fix doesn't address root cause
- **Important**: Missing regression test
- **Suggested**: Similar bugs in related code

### Feature Addition
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, architecture violations
- **Important**: Missing tests for critical paths
- **Suggested**: Additional test coverage, minor refactoring

### UI Refinement
- **Critical**: Missing accessibility for key actions
- **Important**: Not using theme (hardcoded colors)
- **Suggested**: Minor spacing/alignment improvements

### Refactoring
- **Critical**: Changes behavior (should be behavior-preserving)
- **Important**: Incomplete migration (mix of old/new patterns)
- **Suggested**: Additional instances that could be refactored

### Infrastructure
- **Critical**: Hardcoded secrets, no rollback plan
- **Important**: Performance regression in build times
- **Suggested**: Further optimization opportunities

## Special Cases

### Technical Debt
- Acknowledge existing tech debt but don't require fixing in unrelated PR
- Exception: If change makes tech debt worse, it's Important to address

### Scope Creep
- Don't request changes outside PR scope
- Can note as "Future consideration" but not required for this PR

### Linter-Catchable Issues
- Don't flag issues that automated tools handle
- Exception: If linter is misconfigured and missing real issues

### Personal Preferences
- Don't flag unless grounded in project standards or architectural principles
- Use "I-statements" if suggesting alternative approaches

## Summary

**Critical**: Block merge, must fix (security, stability, architecture)
**Important**: Should fix before merge (testing, quality, performance)
**Suggested**: Nice to have, consider effort vs benefit
**Optional**: Acknowledge good practices, keep brief
