# Reviewing Changes

## Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Use structured thinking throughout your review process. Plan your analysis in `<thinking>` tags before providing final feedback. This improves accuracy by 40% according to research.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Review Threads

Always check for existing comment threads to avoid duplicate comments:

<thinking>
Before creating any comments:
1. Is this a fresh review or re-review of the same PR?
2. What existing discussion might already exist?
3. Which findings should update existing threads vs create new?
</thinking>

**Thread Detection Procedure:**

1. **Fetch existing comment count:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr-number> --json comments --jq '.comments | length'
   ```

2. **If count = 0:** No existing threads. Skip to Step 2 (all comments will be new).

3. **If count > 0:** Fetch full comment data to check for existing threads.
   ```bash
   gh pr view <pr-number> --json comments --jq '.comments[] | {id, path, line, body}' > pr_comments.json
   ```

4. **Parse existing threads:** Extract file paths, line numbers, and issue summaries from previous review comments.
   - Build map: `{file:line → {comment_id, issue_summary, resolved}}`
   - Note which issues already have active discussions

5. **Matching Strategy (Hybrid Approach):**
   When you identify an issue to comment on:
   - **Exact match:** Same file + same line number → existing thread found
   - **Nearby match:** Same file + line within ±5 → existing thread found
   - **No match:** Create new inline comment

6. **Handling Evolved Issues:**
   - **Issue persists unchanged:** Respond in existing thread with update
   - **Issue resolved:** Note resolution in thread response (can mark as resolved if supported)
   - **Issue changed significantly:** Resolve/close old thread, create new comment explaining evolution

### Step 2: Detect Change Type

<thinking>
Analyze the changeset systematically:
1. What files were modified? (code vs config vs docs)
2. What is the PR/commit title indicating?
3. Is there new functionality or just modifications?
4. What's the risk level of these changes?
</thinking>

Analyze the changeset to determine the primary change type:

**Detection Rules:**
- **Dependency Update**: Only gradle files changed (`libs.versions.toml`, `build.gradle.kts`) with version number modifications
- **Bug Fix**: PR/commit title contains "fix", "bug", or issue ID; addresses existing broken behavior
- **Feature Addition**: New files, new ViewModels, significant new functionality
- **UI Refinement**: Only UI/Compose files changed, layout/styling focus
- **Refactoring**: Code restructuring without behavior change, pattern improvements
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD files, Gradle config, build scripts, tooling changes

If changeset spans multiple types, use the most complex type's checklist.

### Step 3: Load Appropriate Checklist

Based on detected type, read the relevant checklist file:

- **Dependency Update** → `checklists/dependency-update.md` (expedited review)
- **Bug Fix** → `checklists/bug-fix.md` (focused review)
- **Feature Addition** → `checklists/feature-addition.md` (comprehensive review)
- **UI Refinement** → `checklists/ui-refinement.md` (design-focused review)
- **Refactoring** → `checklists/refactoring.md` (pattern-focused review)
- **Infrastructure** → `checklists/infrastructure.md` (tooling-focused review)

The checklist provides:
- Multi-pass review strategy
- Type-specific focus areas
- What to check and what to skip
- Structured thinking guidance

### Step 4: Execute Review with Structured Thinking

<thinking>
Before diving into details:
1. What are the highest-risk areas of this change?
2. Which architectural patterns need verification?
3. What security implications exist?
4. How should I prioritize my findings?
5. What tone is appropriate for this feedback?
</thinking>

Follow the checklist's multi-pass strategy, thinking through each pass systematically.

### Step 5: Consult Reference Materials As Needed

Load reference files only when needed for specific questions:

- **Issue prioritization** → `reference/priority-framework.md` (Critical vs Suggested vs Optional)
- **Phrasing feedback** → `reference/review-psychology.md` (questions vs commands, I-statements)
- **Architecture questions** → `reference/architectural-patterns.md` (MVVM, Hilt DI, module org, error handling)
- **Security questions (quick reference)** → `reference/security-patterns.md` (common patterns and anti-patterns)
- **Security questions (comprehensive)** → `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#security` (full zero-knowledge architecture)
- **Testing questions** → `reference/testing-patterns.md` (unit tests, mocking, null safety)
- **UI questions** → `reference/ui-patterns.md` (Compose patterns, theming)
- **Style questions** → `docs/STYLE_AND_BEST_PRACTICES.md`

### Step 6: Document Findings

## 🛑 STOP: Determine Output Format FIRST

<thinking>
Before writing ANY output, answer this critical question:
1. Did I find ANY issues (Critical, Important, Suggested, or Questions)?
2. If NO issues found → This is a CLEAN PR → Use 2-3 line minimal format and STOP
3. If issues found → Use verdict + critical issues list + inline comments format
4. NEVER create praise sections or elaborate on correct implementations
</thinking>

**Decision Tree:**

```
Do you have ANY issues to report (Critical/Important/Suggested/Questions)?
│
├─ NO → CLEAN PR
│   └─ Use 2-3 line format:
│       "**Overall Assessment:** APPROVE
│        [One sentence describing what PR does well]"
│   └─ STOP. Do not proceed to detailed format guidance.
│
└─ YES → PR WITH ISSUES
    └─ Use minimal summary + inline comments:
        "**Overall Assessment:** APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES
         **Critical Issues:**
         - [issue with file:line]
         See inline comments for details."
```

## Special Case: Clean PRs with No Issues

When you find NO critical, important, or suggested issues:

**Minimal Approval Format (REQUIRED):**
```
**Overall Assessment:** APPROVE

[One sentence describing what the PR does well]
```

**Examples:**
- "Clean refactoring following established patterns"
- "Solid bug fix with comprehensive test coverage"
- "Well-structured feature implementation meeting all standards"

**NEVER do this for clean PRs:**
- ❌ Multiple sections (Key Strengths, Changes, Code Quality, etc.)
- ❌ Listing everything that was done correctly
- ❌ Checkmarks for each file or pattern followed
- ❌ Elaborate praise or detailed positive analysis
- ❌ Tables, statistics, or detailed breakdowns

**Why brevity matters:**
- Respects developer time (quick approval = move forward faster)
- Reduces noise in PR conversations
- Saves tokens and processing time
- Focuses attention on PRs that actually need discussion

**If you're tempted to write more than 3 lines for a clean PR, STOP. You're doing it wrong.**

<thinking>
Before writing each comment:
1. Is this issue Critical, Important, Suggested, or just Acknowledgment?
2. Should I ask a question or provide direction?
3. What's the rationale I need to explain?
4. What code example would make this actionable?
5. Is there a documentation reference to include?
</thinking>

**CRITICAL**: Use summary comment + inline comments approach.

**Review Comment Structure**:
- Create ONE summary comment with overall verdict + critical issues list
- Create separate inline comment for EACH specific issue on the exact line with full details
- Summary directs readers to inline comments ("See inline comments for details")
- Do NOT duplicate issue details between summary and inline comments

### CRITICAL: No Praise-Only Comments

❌ **NEVER** create inline comments solely for positive feedback
❌ **NEVER** create summary sections like "Strengths", "Good Practices", "What Went Well"
❌ **NEVER** use inline comments to elaborate on correct implementations

Focus exclusively on actionable feedback. Reserve comments for issues requiring attention.

**Inline Comment Format** (REQUIRED: Use `<details>` Tags):

**MUST use `<details>` tags for ALL inline comments.** Only severity + one-line description should be visible; all other content must be collapsed.

```
[emoji] **[SEVERITY]**: [One-line issue description]

<details>
<summary>Details and fix</summary>

[Code example or specific fix]

[Rationale explaining why]

Reference: [docs link if applicable]
</details>
```

**Visibility Rule:**
- **Visible:** Severity prefix (emoji + text) + one-line description
- **Collapsed in `<details>`:** Code examples, rationale, explanations, references

**Example inline comment**:
```
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Exposes mutable state

<details>
<summary>Details and fix</summary>

Change `MutableStateFlow<State>` to `StateFlow<State>`:

\```kotlin
private val _state = MutableStateFlow<State>()
val state: StateFlow<State> = _state.asStateFlow()
\```

Exposing MutableStateFlow allows external mutation, violating MVVM unidirectional data flow.

Reference: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#mvvm-pattern
</details>
```

**Summary Comment Format (REQUIRED - No Exceptions):**

When you have issues to report, use this format ONLY:

```
**Overall Assessment:** APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES

**Critical Issues** (if any):
- [One-line summary with file:line reference]

See inline comments for all details.
```

**Maximum Length**: 5-10 lines total, regardless of PR size or complexity.

**No exceptions for**:
- ❌ Large PRs (10+ files)
- ❌ Multiple issue domains
- ❌ High-severity issues
- ❌ Complex changes

All details belong in inline comments with `<details>` tags, NOT in the summary.

**Output Format Rules**:

**What to Include:**
- **Inline comments**: Create separate comment for EACH specific issue with full details in `<details>` tag
- **Summary comment**: Overall assessment (APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES) + list of CRITICAL issues only
- **Severity levels** (hybrid emoji + text format):
  - ⚠️ **CRITICAL** (blocking)
  - 📋 **IMPORTANT** (should fix)
  - 💡 **SUGGESTED** (nice to have)
  - ❓ **QUESTION** (seeking clarification)

**What to Exclude:**
- **No duplication**: Never repeat inline comment details in the summary
- **No Important/Suggested in summary**: Only CRITICAL blocking issues belong in summary
- **No "Good Practices"/"Strengths" sections**: Never include positive commentary sections
- **No "Action Items" section**: This duplicates inline comments - avoid entirely
- **No verbose analysis**: Keep detailed analysis (compilation status, security review, rollback plans) in inline comments only

### ❌ Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**DO NOT:**
- Create multiple summary sections (Strengths, Recommendations, Test Coverage Status, Architecture Compliance)
- Duplicate critical issues in both summary and inline comments
- Write elaborate descriptions in summary (details belong in inline comments)
- Exceed 5-10 lines for simple PRs
- Create inline comments that only provide praise

**DO:**
- Put verdict + critical issue list ONLY in summary
- Put ALL details (explanations, code, rationale) in inline comments with `<details>` collapse
- Keep summary to 5-10 lines maximum, regardless of PR size or your analysis depth
- Focus comments exclusively on actionable issues

**Visibility Guidelines:**
- **Inline comments visible**: Severity + one-line description only
- **Inline comments collapsed**: Code examples, rationale, references in `<details>` tag
- **Summary visible**: Verdict + critical issues list only

See `examples/review-outputs.md` for complete examples.

## Core Principles

- **Minimal reviews for clean PRs**: 2-3 lines when no issues found (see Step 6 format guidance)
- **Issues-focused feedback**: Only comment when there's something actionable; acknowledge good work briefly without elaboration (see priority-framework.md:145-166)
- **Appropriate depth**: Match review rigor to change complexity and risk
- **Specific references**: Always use `file:line_number` format for precise location
- **Actionable feedback**: Say what to do and why, not just what's wrong
- **Constructive tone**: Ask questions for design decisions, explain rationale, focus on code not people
- **Efficient reviews**: Use multi-pass strategy, time-box reviews, skip what's not relevant
