/**
 * Creates an instance of [CredentialExchangeCompletionManager] using a DSL-style builder.
 *
 * This function is the entry point for handling the completion of a credential exchange flow,
 * such as after a user has successfully created or selected a passkey.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * val completionManager = credentialExchangeCompletionManager(activity) {
 *     // Configuration options can be added here if the DSL is extended in the future.
 * }
 *
 * // Use the completionManager to finish the credential exchange.
 * completionManager.completeCredentialExport(...)
 * ```
 *
 * @param activity The [Activity] that initiated the credential exchange operation. This is
 * used to send back the result to the calling application (e.g., the browser).
 * @param config A lambda with [CredentialExchangeCompletionManagerBuilder] as its receiver,
 * allowing for declarative configuration of the manager.
 *
 * @return A configured [CredentialExchangeCompletionManager] instance.
