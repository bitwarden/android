# Localization (l10n)

[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/bitwarden-mobile/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/bitwarden-mobile)

We use a translation tool called [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com) to help manage our localization efforts across many different languages.

If you are interested in helping translate the Bitwarden mobile app into another language (or make a translation correction), please register an account at Crowdin and join our project here: https://crowdin.com/project/bitwarden-mobile

If the language that you are interested in translating is not already listed, create a new account on Crowdin, join the project, and contact the project owner (https://crowdin.com/profile/kspearrin).

You can read Crowdin's getting started guide for translators here: https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/
